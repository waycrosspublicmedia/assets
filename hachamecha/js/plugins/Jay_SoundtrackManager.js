 /*:
 * @plugindesc Contains a number of special controls for BGM tracks.
 *
 * @author Jason R. Godding
 *
 * @param BGM Override Switch
 * @type Switch
 * @desc If the chosen switch is turned on, normal BGM and ME commands will be ignored.
 *
 * @help This plugin allows you to load and play music tracks with a number
 * of features not included in RPG Maker MV normally.
 *
 * There are three main commands:
 *
 * ===LOADING A TRACK===
 *
 * Plugin command:
 * LoadBGM nameOfTrack [parameter=value] [parameter=value] ...
 *
 * This command loads a BGM track into memory. If not loaded, PlayBGM will
 * not work. Loading takes a second or two, so make sure to load it before
 * you need it.
 * 
 * "nameOfTrack" is the file name of the track in your audio\bgm folder.
 * Do not include the extension. Names cannot contain spaces, so you
 * should_use_underscores OrCamelCase when naming tracks.
 *
 * Loaded tracks are saved to the game's save file, and will be automatically
 * re-loaded when the save file is loaded.
 * 
 * All parameters are optional. They are separated by spaces, but cannot
 * contain any spaces within them (including before and after = signs).
 * Valid parameters are:
 *
 * alias=thisTracksAlias
 *
 * If you give a track an alias, you can refer to it by that alias in the
 * future when playing back or clearing it. This also allows you to create
 * multiple instances of a single track with different parameters.
 * The default alias is the same as the name of the track.
 * No two loaded tracks can have the same alias. If you try to load another
 * track with the same alias, the first will be unloaded and replaced
 * by the second.
 *
 * volume=50
 *
 * Sets the volume of the track. Works the same as the default editor, but
 * allows for more values.
 * Default is 100.
 *
 * pan=10
 * 
 * Sets the left/right pan of the track. Works the same as the default editor,
 * but allows for more values.
 * Default is 0.
 *
 * pitch=125
 *
 * Sets the pitch of the track. Works the same as the default editor, but
 * allows for more values.
 * Default is 100.
 * Please note that the built-in AudioManager sometimes behaves oddly
 * with pitch values other than 100, and it might prevent variable mix
 * from working, or user-defined starting points from being used.
 *
 * tempoRatio=120/160
 *
 * Used for variable mix tracks. One track must be considered the "default"
 * tempo, and all others must be defined as ratios of the default tempo over
 * the other tracks'. For example, if the "default" is 180 beats per minute,
 * and you want to load a track with a tempo of 144 beats per minute, then
 * the tempoRatio of the second track should be 180/144 (or 5/4).
 * Ignored when not played as a variable mix.
 * Accepts fractions and decimals. Default is 1.0.
 *
 * loopstart=12345
 *
 * Overrides the track's LOOPSTART metadata. If not included, the standard
 * LOOPSTART will be used. Use sample number as you would in LOOPSTART.
 *
 * looplength=23456
 *
 * Overrides the track's LOOPLENGTH metadata. If not included, the standard
 * LOOPLENGTH will be used. Use sample number as you would in LOOPLENGTH.
 *
 * playFrom=5432
 *
 * Starts playback at the sample number included. Ignored for variable mix
 * playback, or when playing another instance of the same track (forceFromStart
 * in the PlayBGM command can force it to start from this point anyway.)
 * Default is 0.
 *
 * sampleRate=56789
 *
 * If you're using certain file types, like OPUS, that don't have a built-in
 * sample rate, define one here. If the file has a built-in sample rate, this
 * will go unused. Default is 44100, which is standard, so you usually will
 * not need to set this even if you're using an alternate file type.
 *
 * ===PLAYING A TRACK===
 *
 * Plugin command:
 * PlayBGM trackAlias [parameter=value] [parameter=value] ...
 *
 * Plays a loaded BGM from its alias. If the given BGM was not loaded, this
 * command will do nothing.
 *
 * Some parameters from loading can be overridden by the play command.
 * Notably, pitch is not one of them (it has inconsistent behavior), so if
 * you want to play the track at a different pitch, set it with the load
 * command.
 *
 * "trackAlias" is the name or alias of the track that was loaded. If an
 * alias was provided, it must be used here; using the name of the track won't
 * work.
 *
 * Since loading tracks takes time, if given enough load time before calling
 * PlayBGM, the tracks will start significantly sooner than they would otherwise.
 * 
 * All parameters are optional. They are separated by spaces, but cannot
 * contain any spaces within them (including before and after = signs).
 * Valid parameters are:
 *
 * volume=70
 *
 * Overrides the volume setting.
 *
 * pan=-5
 * 
 * Overrides the pan setting.
 * 
 * loopstart=5432
 *
 * Overrides both the LOOPSTART setting in the track's metadata and the
 * loopstart setting in the LoadBGM command.
 *
 * looplength=6543
 *
 * Overrides both the LOOPLENGTH setting in the track's metadata and the
 * looplength setting in the LoadBGM command.
 * 
 * playfrom=787878
 *
 * Starts playback at the sample number included. Ignored for variable mix
 * playback, or when playing another instance of the same track when
 * forceFromStart is not set. Overrides any value given in the LoadBGM command.
 *
 * variable (or variablemix or continue)
 *
 * When set, the track starts from a point relative to the current playback
 * position of the current track. Used for allowing the music to flow cleanly
 * between related tracks. When the tracks have defined tempoRatio values, it
 * calculates the starting point based on the ratio of their tempos; otherwise,
 * it starts from the same sample number.
 * Automatically sets crossFade, but the "instant" parameter can cancel that.
 *
 * crossFade
 *
 * When set, the currently-playing track will fade out and the new track will
 * fade in simultaneously. If there is no track currently playing, there will
 * not be any fade-in unless the fadeIn parameter is set. You cannot use
 * cross-fading between two tracks with the same alias (but you can use it
 * between two instances of the same track with different aliases); if you
 * try, it will be ignored.
 *
 * fadeIn
 *
 * When set, and when cross-fading is not set or does not apply, the track
 * will fade in as it starts playing.
 * There is no fadeOut command, because the standard RPG Maker command
 * works fine.
 *
 * instant
 *
 * Cancels the automatic application of crossFade from variable mix tracks.
 *
 * fadeTime=1.5
 *
 * Sets how long, in seconds, cross-fading and fadeIn commands take. Allows
 * decimals.
 * Default is 1.0.
 *
 * forceFromStart
 *
 * Normally, when a new "Play BGM" command is played using the same track
 * as what is presently playing, it continues playback from the same point.
 * "forceFromStart" changes this behavior, so it will always start from the
 * beginning of the track (or the "playFrom" point).
 * Ignored for variable tracks, and meaningless when the currently-playing
 * track is not the same as the track being played.
 *
 * ===CLEARING A TRACK===
 *
 * Plugin command:
 * ClearBGM [trackAlias]
 *
 * Too many tracks loaded into memory at once will slow the game and may
 * even crash it. Though I've found that a decent-quality PC can keep
 * literally hundreds of BGM tracks loaded simultaneously, best not to
 * push it - especially if you're aiming to create a mobile game!
 *
 * If you provide an alias to the command, it will clear that track
 * from memory (if it hasn't been loaded, nothing will happen.) If you
 * don't, all tracks will be cleared from memory at once. This will
 * not affect any tracks currently playing; they won't be able to be
 * called with PlayBGM any more, but they'll continue playing.
 *
 * ===OTHER THINGS TO NOTE===
 *
 * If you play the same track that is currently playing with different
 * loop settings, without forceFromStart, it will work fine and continue
 * playing with the new loop settings, which can be used for helping
 * sync scenes with the action in the game... just so long as the new
 * end of the loop is after the sample that is currently playing. If it
 * is before, the track will jump back to a point inside the new loop,
 * which may sound jarring and should probably be avoided (it won't
 * hurt anything, though.)
 *
 * Any loaded track whose alias is the same as its track name will be
 * played as though run through PlayBGM if played through any normal
 * playback methods, allowing you to use some of the features for
 * automatic playback situations (like battles or riding vehicles.)
 *
 * ====================================
 *
 * Version 3.2 - Added support for file types beyond standard OGG.
 *
 * Version 3.1.3 - Fixes an issue where tracks would remain loaded
 * between multiple save files played in the same session.
 *
 * Version 3.1.2 - Actually makes the BGM Override Switch work (oops!)
 *
 * Version 3.1.1 - Fixed another bug in ClearBGM
 *
 * Version 3.1 - Added BGM Override Switch option.
 *
 * Version 3.0.1 - Fixed a bug in ClearBGM
 *
 * Version 3.0 - Premium version:
 *  - Became "Soundtrack Manager" instead of "Variable Mix Manager"
 *  - Now does things other than variable mix tracks:
 *  -- Change the loop points of a track on the fly
 *  -- Start a track partway through
 *  -- Cross-fade between unrelated tracks
 *  -- See above for full details
 *  - Parameters are now defined by name instead of position in command.
 *
 * Version 2.0 - Not released to public - Allows multiple tracks to be loaded.
 *
 * Version 1.0.2 - Small robustness fix most people won't even notice.
 *
 * Version 1.0.1 - Fixed a game-crashing bug if you saved after loading a
 * variable track, but before playing it.
 *
 * Version 1.0 - First version.
 *
 * This version of the plugin is not free to use; please purchase before using.
 * Do not distribute or claim ownership.
 * When used, please credit Jason R. Godding in your project.
